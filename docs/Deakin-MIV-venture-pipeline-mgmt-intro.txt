Mekong Inclusive Ventures

Through tailored diagnostics, bilingual learning tools, and 
capital  readiness  support,  MIV  helps  inclusive  ventures 
strengthen  their  business  models,  align  with  GEDSI  and 
climate impact goals, and access catalytic funding.

In  addition  to  direct  venture  support,  MIV  plays  an 
advocacy  role  by  educating  funders,  foundations,  and 
entrepreneur support organisations across the region.

Problem Statement

Inclusive impact ventures in Cambodia and 
Southeast Asia often lack access to structured 
support systems that can track their journey from 
onboarding through to investment readiness. 

MIV currently manages multiple ventures with 
varying levels of documentation, narrative clarity, 
impact metrics, and engagement history—making it 
difficult to assess pipeline progress, ensure GEDSI 
alignment, and coordinate partner introductions 
efficiently. 

Existing off-the-shelf CRM or project tools are not 
tailored to the unique needs of a mission-driven 
venture studio that prioritizes gender and disability 
inclusion.

The Washington Short Set

is  a  brief, 
The  Washington  Short  Set 
standardized  set  of  questions  designed  to 
identify  persons  with  disabilities  across  six 
functional domains: seeing, hearing, walking, 
cognition, self-care, and communication. 

It is widely used in censuses and surveys to 
ensure consistent disability data collection. 

By  focusing  on  functional  limitations  rather 
than  medical  diagnoses,  it  enables  more 
inclusive  program  design  and  policy 
targeting.

Data Rooms

A data room is a secure digital repository where ventures store key documents—such as pitch decks, ﬁnancials, and 
policies—for review by investors or partners. It functions as a central hub that ensures transparent, organized, and 
controlled access to critical information during due diligence.

Key considerations

Founder side

● Usability

● Interactivity - easy to use and intuitive

● Low cost - preferably nil to use tools

Impact Measurement

● Key focus areas - agri, gender, climate

● Deep dive IRIS

○ Use AI plug in- what is the cost and options

○ ChatGPT integration? Or plug in?

MIV side

● Dashboard approach for tracking

○ Who has updated, something new

○ Where they are at

● Affordability

● Fast track vs slow track

Approaches to Impact Measurement

GIIN and IRIS

Disability Lens Investing

Disability lens investing is an inclusive investment approach that seeks to generate 
financial returns while advancing equity for people with disabilities. 

It supports ventures led by, serving, or inclusive of persons with disabilities across 
products, employment, and governance. 

This lens challenges traditional investment norms by recognizing disability as a source 
of innovation, resilience, and untapped market value.

Disability lens investing has an intersectionality with Gender and Child Lens Investing.

Integration

Integrating Disability Lens Investing (DLI) across the MIV Venture Studio platform 
would involve embedding disability inclusion at every key stage of venture support 
— from onboarding and diagnostics to capital facilitation and ecosystem advocacy.

DLI integration

Studio Function

Disability Lens Integration

1. Venture Intake & 
Onboarding

Intake forms include questions on disability-led leadership, inclusive hiring practices, and products/services 
designed for or accessible to people with disabilities.

2. Diagnostics & 
Readiness Assessment

Readiness tools assess ventures’ disability inclusion across governance, workforce, customer base, and 
operational accessibility.

3. IRIS+ Impact Metrics 
Selection

Ventures are encouraged to select disability-relevant IRIS+ metrics (e.g., PI4060, OI7939) as part of their 
impact reporting.

4. GEDSI Dashboard

Visual dashboards track progress on disability inclusion KPIs alongside gender and social inclusion metrics.

5. Capital Readiness & 
Introductions

Ventures with strong disability inclusion proﬁles are ﬂagged for investors aligned with DLI mandates or 
inclusive capital funds.

6. Learning Modules

Courses include “Disability Inclusion 101” and “Designing Products for Accessibility” tailored for founders and 
ESOs.

7. Studio-Wide Advocacy DLI case studies and studio-generated data feed into funder education, ESO partner toolkits, and regional 

mainstreaming efforts.

Existing Tools for Exploration & Price Comparison

Airtable

A powerful, user-friendly database tool that combines spreadsheet and relational database features. Ideal for tracking venture 
profiles, readiness stages, IRIS+ metrics, and linking data across multiple tables (e.g., documents, intros, milestones). Highly 
customizable with automation and integration options.

Notion

An all-in-one workspace for documentation, templates, and light database functions. Excellent for onboarding narratives, SOPs, 
and founder-facing guidance. Not as strong for complex data tracking, but highly intuitive and collaborative.

Google Workspace (Docs, Drive, Sheets)

Widely accessible suite for real-time collaboration and document storage. Google Drive can host venture data rooms, while 
Sheets can support lightweight tracking if structured correctly. Best used in combination with more robust tools like Airtable.

Miro

A visual collaboration and whiteboarding platform. Useful for mapping venture journeys, visualizing readiness stages, or clustering 
ventures by theme or geography. Can complement Airtable with embedded maps or flow diagrams.

Zapier / Make (formerly Integromat)

Automation tools that connect apps like Airtable, Notion, Google Drive, and Gmail. Helpful for triggering alerts, status changes, or 
follow-ups when ventures complete specific actions (e.g., upload a pitch deck or reach a readiness milestone).

Remaining Needs

1. Integrated GEDSI Metrics Tracking

Need: Dashboards that track the gender, disability, and social inclusion progress of each venture.
 Current Gap: Most tools allow data input but lack ready-made dashboards for inclusion metrics.

2. IRIS+ Metric Selection Interface

Need: Ventures should be able to easily explore and select relevant IRIS+ impact metrics based on their model and goals.
 Current Gap: No off-the-shelf plugin for IRIS+ exists in Airtable or Notion.

3. Document Signing & Verification

Need: Ventures must be able to sign NDAs, MOUs, and readiness agreements electronically, with proper version control.
 Current Gap: Airtable and Notion do not have native e-signature support.

4. Introduction & Touchpoint Log

Need: Track every interaction or referral MIV facilitates between ventures and capital providers or ecosystem actors.
 Current Gap: No existing CRM tool in use to log and timestamp these interactions.
